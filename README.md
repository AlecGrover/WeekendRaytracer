# WeekendRaytracer

An implementation of a raytracer built as practice and a demo to display programming and 3D math fundamentals!
Pure C++, just a straightforward demo. Currently outputs formatted for .PPM image files, planning on changing
that to a more conventional output method, but focus right now is on the product itself :)
